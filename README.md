# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

**I am currently working on** one of [Code.gov's 16 repos](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov), a class at [FeM](https://frontendmasters.com/) or [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) (and planning to add [Kent Dodd's Testing JS](https://testingjavascript.com/) soon), or a [personal coding project](https://github.com/jcastle/365DaysOfCode).  
**I am currently learning/refreshing** on javascript or frontend engineering config (e.g., automated testing, CI/CD).  
**Ask me about** open source software (OSS) coding practices, [federal open source policies and practices](https://github.com/jcastle/dissertation_publishingOSS), frontend engineering topics (i.e., coding, config, testing), or academic pursuits and navigation (I was in school for 32 years, elementary to PhD completion, eeks!).  
**You can reach me** by [email](josephrcastle@gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jrcastle_vt), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrcastle/).  
**Fun facts** include having an awesome family, serving in the US Army and being deployed, working at the White House, obtaining a PhD, and often training and racing in an ultra-endurance mountain bike or running event ([resume](https://github.com/jcastle/dissertation_publishingOSS/blob/master/Resume.pdf), just in case ðŸ˜‰ ).
